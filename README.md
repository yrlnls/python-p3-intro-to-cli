# Intro to CLIs

## Learning Goals

- Use your Python skills to build an interactive command-line application.
- Follow best practices in CLI design in Python.

***

## Key Vocab

- **Command Line**: a text-based interface that is built into your computer's
operating system. It allows you to access the files and applications on your
computer manually or through scripts.
- **Terminal**: the application in Mac OS that allows you to access the command
line.
- **Command Shell/Powershell**: the applications in Windows that allow you to access
the command line.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: a text-based interface used to run programs,
manage files and interact with objects in memory. As the name suggests, it is
run from the command line.

## Introduction

Now that we're in the home stretch of Phase 3, it's time to prepare for your
project. You will see the rubric for the project in the next page in this
module, but before we get there, let's take some time to explore the format for
the project: a **command-line interface** (or **CLI**).

A CLI is a program that is run from the command-line and provides a text-based
interface to allow you to carry out various tasks. While the functionality of
CLIs is limited by the capabilities of Terminal (in Mac OS) and Command
Shell/Powershell (in Windows), _everything you have learned in Phase 3 can be
carried out through a CLI._

## Building a Simple CLI

Before we dive into best practices for Python CLIs, let's build a very simple
CLI. Fork and clone this lesson from GitHub and open up `grade_reports.py`
from the `lib/` directory to follow along.

The first thing that we need to do is scaffold our CLI so that it can be run
from the command line. To do this, we'll need to create a script. There are two
pieces we know are going into the script regardless of the particulars: the
**shebang** and our `if __name__ = '__main__'` block:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

if __name__ == '__main__':
    pass
```

Remember that the shebang tells the command line that this program should be
executed using the Python 3 interpreter. We can technically still run this as a
script without it, but that would require us to write
`python grade_reports.py` every time we wanted to do so. Since other
programmers using your CLI might not know about this requirement, you should
always include the shebang. In the `lib/` directory, run
`chmod +x grade_reports.py` to make your script executable.

The `if __name__ == '__main__'` block tells the interpreter that this script
should only be run if `./grade_reports.py` itself is being called from the
command line. This is important if you want to import any objects from
`grade_reports.py` into other modules- if you don't include this code block,
the full script will be run whenever your other module runs the import. That's
not likely to be a helpful feature in your CLI.

Let's start to add some very simple functionality to our CLI. We want to
produce a grade report a full class of students; we're going to use Python's
`input()` and `open()` functions to do so.

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def create_grade_report(student_grades):
    with open('reports/grade_report.txt', 'w') as gr:
        gr.write(student_grades)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    student_grades = input("Student name, grade: ")
    create_grade_report(student_grades)
```

Run `./grade_reports.py` to execute your script:

```console
Student name, grade: Ben, F
```

Check the `reports` directory- you should see that `grade_report.txt` has
been generated and contains your input! Still, this is not really useful for
generating grade reports. Let's use a `while` loop to continue collecting
student grades until there are no more to enter and a `for` loop to write the
grades line-by-line:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

def create_grade_report(student_grades):
    with open('./reports/grade_report.txt', 'w') as gr:
        for grade in student_grades:
            # add '\n' to write grades on separate lines
            gr.write(grade + '\n')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    student_grades = []

    grade = input("Student name, grade: ")
    while grade:
        student_grades.append(grade)
        # end when no grade is entered
        grade = input("Student name, grade: ")

    create_grade_report(student_grades)
```

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>Which mode would we set <code>open()</code> to if we wanted to update
        <code>grade_report.txt</code>, rather than overwrite it?</em>
  </summary>

  <h3><code>'a'</code> for "append".</h3>
</details>
<br/>

Now let's enter a classroom's worth of grades:

```console
Student name, grade: Ben, F
Student name, grade: Prabhdip, A
Student name, grade: Alvee, A
Student name, grade: Jeff, B
Student name, grade: Jerrica, A
Student name, grade: Gustave, F
Student name, grade: Katie, A
Student name, grade:             # hit enter to complete
```

Check the `reports/` directory again- nowyou should see that `grade_report.txt`
has been regenerated and contains grades for all of your students!

There are still, of course, many ways to improve this CLI. The instructions
for the end user could certainly be much clearer. Maybe you want to be able to
toggle between updating and generating new grade reports-
[`argparse`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html) would be
helpful for that. Maybe you want timestamps for your grade reports to help you
keep them organized- [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html)
would be very helpful there. Maybe you're (rightfully) biased against `.txt`
files and want to keep your data in a spreadsheet-
[`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) would be the right module
to import there.

## Best Practices in CLI Design

Building a simple CLI doesn't take up too much code, but when you start to
include a wide range of functionality in a single CLI, it can start to get
messy. To make your life easier, keep a few things in mind as you work on
your Phase 3 project:

### Separate User Input from Functionality

A CLI depends on user input and a lot of code to act on it, but that doesn't
mean it all has to be in the same place. As with any other Python program,
your CLI should be grouped into classes and functions. Your scripted code- that
is, the code inside of your `if __name__ == '__main__'` block- should _only
include user input and calls to classes and functions._

Let's take a look:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python3

class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, user_input)
        self.value = user_input

def my_function(my_object):
    # returns a final value for the CLI workflow

if __name__ == '__main__':
    user_input = input("Enter something here: ")
    my_object = MyClass(user_input)
    print(my_function(my_object))
```

Here, we've factored most of our code into a class `MyClass` and a function
`my_function()`. The scripted portion of the CLI only takes user input, calls
`MyClass` and `my_function()`, and outputs the final value of the workflow. You
may find it necessary at times to include `for` loops, `while` loops, and
`if/elif/else` statements in this portion of the CLI, but make sure to separate
and organize your code into classes and functions whenever possible.

To make this even clearer, you can separate related functions and classes into
different files and **import** them into your CLI script.

### Validate User Input

You may have noticed in our `grade_reports` CLI that we did _not_ validate user
input. If you wanted to enter a number or a nonsensical string, not only could
you have done so, but it would have been written to `grade_report.txt`!

A good CLI will check the format of user input before using it to perform any
actions. This can be carried out using regular expressions through the [`re`
module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html), the built-in `type()` and
`isinstance()` functions, the various Python operators, and more.

<details>
  <summary>
    <em>What two arguments does <code>isinstance()</code> take?</em>
  </summary>

  <h3>An object and a class.</h3>
  <p><code>isinstance()</code> will check to see if an object is an instance of
     a specific class.</p>
</details>
<br/>

### Keep the End User Informed

You may have noticed while using Pipenv that many things are printed to the
command line while external libraries are added to your virtual environment.
This lets you know that Pipenv is doing its job. Most importantly, Pipenv
finishes with a message as to what was installed, where it was installed, and
how to access it later on.

Compare this with our `grade_reports` CLI. What do we see when the script
finishes execution? We can find our new file in the `reports` directory, but
how would someone who downloaded your CLI from PyPI know that?

A CLI should always inform the end user of what it is doing and where to find
output. This should always happen through the CLI itself, but it's often
helpful to store the messages from a session in a `logs` directory as well.

### Use External Libraries to Standardize Your Code

While we at Flatiron encourage you to show us as much of your amazing
hand-written code as possible, it's often best to use popular external libraries
to handle common programming tasks. This makes it easier to "onboard" new
developers to your application if you ever need to hire a team to maintain it.

Two popular libraries that will help you make amazing CLIs are
[`Click`](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) and
[`Fire`](https://google.github.io/python-fire/guide/). While we won't require
you to use these in your Phase 3 project, we strongly recommend that you use
one. (It's another library to add to your resumé!)

***

## Conclusion

CLIs are a helpful tool for managing the data on your computer and on remote
servers. A well-built CLI will allow you to let non-technical users complete
many of the same tasks with your application that you can from the Python shell
without very much training at all. Consider the best practices for building CLIs
as you work through the Phase 3 project this week- make sure to look back at
the earlier modules, too!
